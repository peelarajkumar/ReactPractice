My first React Practice App

Steps I have done :

1. React and React DOM using CDN's
2. React.createElement and React.createRoot
3. React element is an Object , render method is used to convert React Object into HTML.

React is Fast because NPM helps React to be Faster

NPM : It manages all the Packages and their dependencies we use !
NPM is a data base for all our Packages.

1.NPM init
2.We need a bundler : Bundler bundles our code and makes production ready.

Parcel , webpack , wheat are some Bundlers and Parcel is one of the powerful bundler.

Parcel :

NPM install -D Parcel

Parcel usages:
npx parcel index.html (building our app in server)

1. It hosts our app on local server
2. It creates a dev build for us
3. Hot Moduler Replacement - make some changes and save , app will automatically update.
